# Thesis Project Repo

In actuality the directory i worked on looked like this 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b60b2a5c-c464-4f04-af5b-c051fc44a244)

There are 2 folders which are not part of the repo here since they were cloned from sources and used as source code for the project.

- The firenet-pdavis folder is from their repository which was cloned which had scripts for reconstruction models using which the images and videos were being converted to a usable format
- I had some ubuntu virtual environment files which I used for the reconstruction models.
